                <h2>ARCHITECTURE</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Architecture images are photographs or illustrations that focus on capturing the design, form, and aesthetic qualities of buildings, structures, and architectural elements. These images provide viewers with a visual representation of architectural styles, techniques, and achievements, showcasing the built environment in various contexts.</p>
                <img src="./Images/architecture/1 arch.jpg" alt="">
                <p> The primary subjects of architecture images are buildings, structures, and architectural elements such as facades, windows, doors, roofs, and details. These subjects may include iconic landmarks, historical monuments, contemporary skyscrapers, residential homes, religious buildings, bridges, and urban landscapes. Composition plays a crucial role in architecture photography, as it helps to emphasize the form, symmetry, lines, shapes, and proportions of the architectural subjects. Photographers may use techniques such as framing, leading lines, perspective, and symmetry to create visually compelling compositions. The choice of angles, viewpoints, and focal lengths can influence the mood and impact of the image</p>
                <p>In addition to capturing overall views of buildings and structures, architecture photographers often focus on capturing details, textures, patterns, and architectural features that add visual interest and depth to the images. Close-up shots of architectural elements such as windows, doors, columns, and ornamentation can provide insights into the craftsmanship and design intent of the building.</p>

                <img src="./Images/architecture/3 arch.jpg" alt="">
                <hr>
                <img src="./Images/architecture/4 arch.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Post-processing techniques, such as color correction, perspective correction, exposure blending, and selective editing, are commonly used to enhance the appearance and visual impact of architecture images. However, it's important to maintain a balance and avoid over-editing that may result in unrealistic or unnatural-looking images.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>Overall, architecture images offer viewers a glimpse into the art, history, and cultural significance of the built environment, highlighting the creativity, innovation, and ingenuity of architects and builders throughout history. Whether capturing iconic landmarks or hidden gems, architecture photography continues to inspire admiration and appreciation for the beauty and diversity of architectural design.</p>
